## Thanks

- [Nathan Nam Tran](https://twitter.com/naistran) for creating [css-in-js-loader](https://github.com/naistran/css-in-js-loader), which served as the initial starting point for [treat](https://seek-oss.github.io/treat), the precursor to this library.
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) for getting us excited about CSS-Variables-in-JS.
- [SEEK](https://www.seek.com.au) for giving us the space to do interesting work.
